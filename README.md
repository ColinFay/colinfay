## Connect with Me

I love to speak around the world, and most of my talks are available on my [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/colinfay), and if you're looking for the video I try to keep the list on [my website](https://colinfay.me/talks-publications/) up to date. 

You can learn more about me on my website [colinfay.me](https://colinfay.me) where I blog on a random basis and on Twitter at [@_ColinFay](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay) where I tweet quite frequently. 

I probably forgot a lot of things here, so feel free to explore my profiles and website, and to contact me if you need my help!
