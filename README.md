### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub account!

I'm Colin, and (probably like a lot of people here), I love writing code. 

My languages of choice are R, JavaScript and Docker. I love building infrastructures and backends. 

Here are some of the things I've been working on lately: 

+ Most of my work can be found at [golemverse.org](https://golemverse.org/)

+ 📦 [`{golem}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem), a framework for building production-grade `{shiny}` applications

+ 📚 [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org), a book about building `{shiny}` applications for production

+ 📦 [`{brochure}`](https://github.com/ColinFay/brochure), Natively Multipage Shiny Apps

I also have a bunch of Docker image I maintain on my [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/colinfay). 

I love to speak around the world, and most of my talks are available on my [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/colinfay), and if you're looking for the video I try to keep the list on [my website](https://colinfay.me/talks-publications/) up to date. 

You can learn more about me on my website [colinfay.me](https://colinfay.me) where I blog on a random basis and on Twitter at [@_ColinFay](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay) where I tweet quite frequently. 

I probably forgot a lot of things here, so feel free to explore my profiles and website, and to contact me if you need my help!
